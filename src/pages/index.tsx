            <strong>Arram Sabeti</strong> was an early employee at Justin.tv and now
            runs ZeroCater, a business which he bootstrapped and ran from a
            spreadsheet for two years and which has since been covered by
            publications such as The New York Times, Forbes, and the Wall Street
            Journal. Tenacious, considerate, and with more utility belts than Batman,
            he spends his free time transforming the Archive into a
            mini-Exploratorium. Ask him about life extension, mad science, or Downton

            (YouTube Instant), but he’ll be the first to remind you that nobody
            really knows what they’re doing. Feross is articulate, humble, a true
            believer in decentralization, and once organized an impromptu JavaScript
            conference to get cheap flights and free lodging in Norway.{' '}

            <strong>Jason Benn</strong> is passionate about better preparing us for
            the coming unemployment crisis. He previously built a digital classroom
            at the Minerva Project (a university startup), and is now tackling the
            problem from another angle by building the machine learning systems at
            Sourceress. He’s been profiled in Cal Newport's "Deep Work" for his habit
            of interleaving work with periods of intense study. Enthusiastic,
            inclusive, a tad gullible, half-giant, and Keeper of Keys and Grounds at
            the Archive, Jason is basically Hagrid.

            molding pricing), BitBlinder (web anonymity network), and worked at
            Addepar. Josh has signed the Founder’s Pledge, has two black belts, and
            is Arram's definition of conscientiousness (despite miscounting the
            number of classes required to graduate as a CS and math major).{' '}

            sewing and circuitry that's now taught in 60 Boston middle schools,
            arbitraged yarn from her dorm room, and designed high-frequency trading
            strategies. She’s diplomatic, has a talent for asking incisive questions,
